# Boilerplate

This is my boilerplate for projects that use Express and Sequelize.

## Initializing your project

Configure the repository

```
yarn cook
```

## Up and running

```
yarn start
```


## Database

run postgres with docker
```
docker-compose up
```
migrate the database
```
yarn sequelize db:migrate
```
